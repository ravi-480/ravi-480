👋 Hi, I’m @ravi-480

👀 I’m interested in frontend and backend web development, problem-solving, and learning new technologies.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced concepts in React.js and exploring backend frameworks like Node.js and Express.js.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to web development or any interesting projects that involve solving real-world problems.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy experimenting with new recipes in my free time and am passionate about cooking as much as I am about coding!
